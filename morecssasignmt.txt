1. Why is it called a pseudo-class?

Pseudo-classes are used to select elements based on their state, such as
when the element is hovered over, when it has focus, or when it is the first or
last child of its parent element.

And it is so called because the term "pseudo-class" literally means "false class." It's called "pseudo" because it's not a real class that you define in your HTML markup, but rather a dynamic state or condition that a particular element can be in.
